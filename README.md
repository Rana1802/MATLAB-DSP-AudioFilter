This MATLAB App lets users design and apply **FIR** or **IIR** filters (Low Pass, High Pass, Band Pass, Band Stop) on audio files using App Designer.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Load `.wav` audio and resample
- Design FIR/IIR filters with user-defined:
  - Filter order
  - Cutoff frequencies
- View:
  - Frequency response
  - Time domain waveform
  - Filtered signal spectrogram
- Play original and filtered audio

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Open `app1.m` in MATLAB.
2. Run the app (`F5` or green run button).
3. Load a `.wav` audio file.
4. Select filter type & parameters.
5. Click **"Design & Apply Filter"**.
6. Play & visualize the filtered output.
